# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict?

* Version control is a method of software management that allows for many file changes to be managed and organized. It's useful because it allows for many people to work on the same code base fluidly that does not interfere with the original code base.
* A branch is a break from the original code base. You would use one when you need to edit a file from the original code base without affecting the code base. An example of this would be implementing or modifying a feature. 
* A commit is when modified changes that a user has been working on are integrated into the original code base. A good commit message should specify what changes were made with enough detail that a person overviewing your commit message would know at a glance what was changed.
* A merge conflict is when there is an attempt to merge a current change, but there has been a change to the master branch that has made this merge impossible.
