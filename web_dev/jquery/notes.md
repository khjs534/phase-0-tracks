0. Release 0: 
	* Find a jquery cheatsheet
	* Do some of the jquery on codecademy to get a feel for the syntax
	* start with small problems to implemnt
1. Release 1:
	* Did the thing.
	* Some fun implementations

		* $(document).ready(function() {
  	  	$('div').mouseenter(function() {
    	    $('div').fadeTo('fast', 1);
    		});
			});
		* $(document).ready(function() {
   			$('div').click(function() {
        	$(this).fadeOut('slow');
    		});
			});
		* $(document).ready(function(){
    		$(".pull-me").click(function(){
        	$('.panel').slideToggle('slow');
    		});
			});
	* I think learning through examples is a good method to get a taste of the syntax, but after you have that you should be able to read documents.
		* Codecademy gave me a taste of some of the syntax I needed to know, but it was often too slow or felt really repetitive. This is more than likely their goal though as they're trying to get people to rote learn syntax

	* Looking at documentation and cheat sheets can often leave more to the imagination. It's a good way to learn explicitly what you want to learn, but it can be hard to find things that you don't really know that you're looking for.
