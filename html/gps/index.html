What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

  The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is that they are basically preset classes that can be used instead of having nested div tags everywhere. Additionally because they are preset they can be used for accessibility with blind impaired people because preset tags can be looked at and used to navigate websites.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

  The browser looks at block elements first and then looks inside of the block elements to display what's inside. if there are other block elements it will load them before loading what's inside those blocks. Other than that it is read top down. There are some blocks like <header> which can be placed at the bottom of your <body> but are displayed on the top like a header. but it would be displayed after everything above it has been displayed.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

  I learned to be very careful about which language sublime is looking at. We had a problem with getting the snippet to work because when opening a new file there is no selected language. So when trying to call the snippet sublime didn't know which language we were looking for and wouldn't load the snippet.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

  Working through the sublime snippet. I can improve my understanding of this concept by practicing creating snippets and having my setting correctly set for sublime.
